>I'm a Duke University graduate with a strong mathematics background and professional experience in forecasting, machine learning, building data production pipelines, and designing and executing projects for causal inference.<br><br>Currently, I work for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors building statistical models and algorithms to analyze data for U.S. monetary policy, financial regulatory policy, and economic research. I conduct all stages of policy and research project analytics, from data processing and algorithm design to statistical analysis and visualization.<br><br>I'm a strong proponent of using data for good, and I believe that data science can help improve the lives of people across the world. In line with that belief, I volunteer with [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/), a data-science non-profit organization that partners with mission driven organizations to improve the world.<br><br>I'm currently leading a team to analyze the effectiveness of young adult employment programs in Philadelphia and to create a targeted program recommendation system to improve individual outcomes. The [Annie E. Casey Foundation](http://www.aecf.org/)) is sponsoring this DataKind project.<br><br>Previously, I co-built and [deployed](http://home-fire-risk.github.io/smoke_alarm_map/) machine learning models to predict the most fire-death at-risk census tracts, optimizing the Red Crossâ€™s national [campaign](http://www.redcross.org/get-help/prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/fire/prevent-home-fire) to install smoke alarms in one million homes across the country.<br><br>Finally, as a note, all analyses and conclusions presented on this website reflect my views and do not indicate concurrence by the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve System.
