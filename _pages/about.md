>I'm a Duke University grad with experience building and deploying statistical models, extracting insights from large datasets, and scoping data science projects. <br><br>Currently, I work for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors building statistical models and algorithms to analyze data for U.S. monetary policy, financial regulatory policy, and economic research. <br><br>I'm also extensively involved with [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/), a data-science non-profit organization that partners with mission driven organizations to improve the world. I recently led a 30-person team to analyze and provide data driven recommendations to improve young adult employment and education programs in Philadelphia. Before that, I co-built and [deployed](http://home-fire-risk.github.io/smoke_alarm_map/) machine learning models to optimize the Red Cross's national [campaign](http://www.redcross.org/get-help/prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/fire/prevent-home-fire) to install 2.5 million smoke detectors across the United States. <br><br>Finally, as a note, all analyses and conclusions presented on this website reflect my views and do not indicate concurrence by the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve System.
