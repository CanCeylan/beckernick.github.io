I'm a Duke University graduate with a strong mathematics background and professional experience in forecasting, machine learning, building data production pipelines, and designing and executing projects for causal inference.<br><br>Currently, I work for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors building statistical models and algorithms to analyze data for U.S. monetary policy, financial regulatory policy, and economic research. I conduct all stages of policy and research project analytics, from data processing and algorithm design to statistical analysis and visualization.<br><br>In my downtime, I volunteer with [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/). I'm currently leading a team to analyze the effectiveness of the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s young adult employment programs and to create a targeted program recommendation system to improve individual outcomes.<br><br>Previously, I co-built and [deployed](http://home-fire-risk.github.io/smoke_alarm_map/) machine-learning models to predict the most fire-death at-risk census tracts, optimizing the Red Cross’s national campaign to install smoke alarms in 1 million homes across the country.


Finally, as a note, all analyses and conclusions presented on this website reflect my views and do not indicate concurrence by the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve System.
