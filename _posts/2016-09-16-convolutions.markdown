Deep learning is all the rage right now. Convolutional neural networks are particularly hot, achieving state of the art performance on image recognition, voice recognition, and text classification tasks.

Since I didn't take any courses on deep learning in college, I figured I should start at the core of convolutional nets to really understand them. So here we go.
